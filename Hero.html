        <h1> Why a hero image is important</h1>

        <p> A hero image serves several purposes on a website. Its most important benefit is that it immediately arrests a visitorâ€™s attention. Since people respond positively to visual content, having a high-resolution image on your website is a good way
            to entice visitors to explore your site further.
        </p>
        <p>A good design is an absolute must for every website these days. It is the first factor that influences a visitor's opinion of your company and plays an important role in increasing conversions. The hero image is a key element in web design. The
            right one can establish trust among visitors and make them interested in what you're offering, while the wrong one can drive them away.
        </p>
        <p>Hero images are also extremely useful for directly engaging your site's visitors; you can display your company's USP, entice visitors to take a particular action using a CTA button, or ask them to sign-up for a service trial. How to select the
            best hero image (with examples)</p>

        <p>Selecting the perfect hero image for your website is a tricky task. The banner image you employ will vary depending on whether you're offering a product, a service, or simply content (blogs). If you want to offer in-depth details about your company,
            then videos can be used as well. But, regardless of what you want it to achieve, the hero image should always be in high-resolution. You should also optimise it to make sure that your site loading time isn't affected as it may dissuade visitors
            with a slow internet connection. Of course, it is impossible to know outright which one will work the best, but narrowing down your options and then testing to see which one is the most effective is the best way to go about it. You can also
            use a slider to display multiple images at a go.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few examples of the different types of hero images to give you an idea of what you can do with them:</p>
